# 📊 Pandas 101 — Data Analysis using Python

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains a complete learning and practice series on *data analysis using Python's Pandas library*.  
It is designed to demonstrate how data can be efficiently read, cleaned, analyzed, and visualized using real-world examples.  
Through this project, I have explored various functionalities of Pandas, from data preprocessing to complex data manipulations and visual storytelling using Matplotlib.  

The project focuses on building a strong foundation in *data wrangling, exploration, and visualization*, which are the key steps in any data analysis or data science workflow.
